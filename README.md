# Integrated Documentation - WIP
known as Integrated Docs

## Its Finished?
It is work in progress, the hard part is done, now I just need to add support for method args, and make some adjustments to RST reader.

## What this is?
It let the user generate documentation for any .gd (GDScript file) since is well commented.

## How it works?
Generates a .rst based on .gd comments
Reads these .rst generated files inside the engine

## Any Example?
yes, just look for the GDReader file how it is commented, and look at the generated_docs/ folder for the result.

## Can I see it working?
yes, Open the Control.tscn and click at the panel node, click update, press f6 and you're done.
